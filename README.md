# Satellite Simulation 
Welcome to the Satellite Simulation repository! This project allows you to simulate the motion of a satellite in space, considering the gravitational forces of the Earth and the Sun, more planets can be added to achieve accurate elliptical orbits. The simulation is implemented using Python and Pygame.
This repository provides a simple yet accurate simulation of a satellite's motion in space. Users can input the mass and distance of the satellite, as well as observe the constant mass and distance of the Earth and the Sun.

### Features 

- User input for mass and distance of the satellite.
- Visualization of the constant mass and distance of the Earth and the Sun.
- Consideration of gravitational forces from each planet.

### Inspiration 

1. Planet Simulation In Python - Tutorial by Tech with Tim - https://youtu.be/WTLPmUHTPqo?feature=shared
2. Simulating Planetry Orbits - https://fiftyexamples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gravity.html
